# A presentation about the new Boutiques Integrator in CBRAIN

This presentation is also a form of internal documentation
about this subsystem, and how it compares to the other
two ways of integrating tools in CBRAIN:

* The standard Ruby integrator, which provides the core API
  for the other two,
* The old Boutiques integrator, based on templated code
  and templated templated views (yep, two levels)
* This new Boutiques integrator here, based on having the
  tool's implementation classes run Ruby code controlled
  by the values of the descriptors.
